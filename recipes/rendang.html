  <h1 id="header">2 | Rendang</h1>
  <p>Originating from the land of Minang in West Sumatra, Rendang has gained popularity worldwide because of its
    distinctive savory flavor. This dish is basically made of slow-cooked, braised pieces of beef that are caramelized
    in coconut milk and a rich mixture of spices. Rendang is traditionally served by Indonesians to honor guests at
    festive occasions such as wedding celebrations and Eid-al-Fitr. The tradition still exists, but now you can find
    Rendang at almost every Minang restaurant in Indonesia.</p>
