  <h1 id="header">1 | Nasi Goreng</h1>
  <p>A highly-versatile dish, Nasi Goreng (literally translated as ‘fried rice’) is an Indonesian dish that has its
    roots in Southern Chinese culture. It mainly consists of seasoned rice stir-fried with pieces of meat and
    vegetables. This dish originated from people’s concern about ways to use leftover rice. It is not clear exactly when
    the Indonesians adopted the recipe of Chinese fried rice and put their own traditional ‘twist’ on Nasi Goreng, but
    some say it happened around the 10th century, during Sriwijaya’s reign when the trade between Indonesia and China
    flourished.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, almost every region in Indonesia had its own signature recipe of Nasi Goreng (such as Nasi Goreng Jawa,
    Nasi Goreng Aceh, Nasi Goreng Padang, etc.) and you can find it in almost every corner of every street.</p>
  <p>As mentioned before, this dish is very versatile, which means if you are having trouble finding one or two
    ingredients, you can always twist the recipe by using alternative ingredients that suit your taste and are easily
    available.</p>
