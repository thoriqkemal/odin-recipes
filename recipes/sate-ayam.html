  <h1 id="header">5 | Sate Ayam</h1>
  <p>The last traditional dish that is so easy to find in Indonesia is Sate Ayam, a grilled chicken skewer served with
    peanut sauce. It is believed that the word ‘Sate’ originated from Tamil ‘catai’, a regional variant of ‘tacai’
    meaning ‘flesh’, which is the indication that the dish was initially developed by Javanese street vendors as an
    adaptation of Indian kebabs. In West Sumatra, there is a popular variant of Sate Ayam dish called Sate Padang, a
    grilled beef skewer served with a distinctive spicy Minang sauce.</p>
  <p>Sate Ayam is very easy to make and you can find all the ingredients at your local store.</p>

  <h3 class="section">Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound of chicken thighs, finely chopped into pieces</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>A pinch of ground white pepper</li>
    <li>A tablespoon of sunflower seed oil</li>
    <li>24 wooden skewers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="section">Curry Paste</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup of water</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons of peanut butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of sweet soy sauce</li>
    <li>A tablespoon of palm sugar</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>A tablespoon of lime juice</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="section">How to Make</h3>
  <p>Mix the chicken thighs, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, white pepper, and sunflower seed oil in a large bowl, then cover and
    refrigerate for 1-2 hours. Make preparations to grill and soak the wooden skewers in water so they don’t burn during
    cooking. Blend water, peanut butter, sweet soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan
    and bring to a boil. Stir well. Remove from heat and add some lime juice. Thread the marinated chicken onto the
    skewers and put three pieces of meat per stick. Put the well-blended peanut sauce in a small bowl and set aside.
    Then brush the sauce over the chicken. Heat a grill pan or a large skillet and put the chicken skewers in batches on
    the pan or the skillet. Cook until the chicken meat turns brown, approximately 1 to 2 minutes per side. Serve warm.
