  <h1 id="header">3 | Bakso</h1>
  <p>Essential comfort food that you can find almost everywhere in Indonesia, from street-vendors to five-star hotels
    and high-class restaurants, Bakso is brothy meatballs that are usually served with noodles, chili paste, and spring
    onions. Is that all? No. It’s as versatile as Nasi Goreng. There are many ways to prepare Bakso, but all the
    variations include meatballs and broth. Originating from the Hokkien word bak-so (肉酥, Pe̍h-ōe-jī: bah-so·), which
    means "fluffy meat" or "minced meat", this dish has its root in Chinese cuisine. Like Nasi Goreng, there is no exact
    history of when the Indonesians adopted this Chinese recipe of meatball soup as their own.</p>
  <img src="./../images/bakso.jpg" alt="bakso" width="500px">
  <p>Many regions of Indonesia give their own twist to Bakso, for example, Bandung make ‘bakso cuanki’ (meatballs made
    with starch flour) and Malang make ‘bakso bakar’ (grilled meatball dish with broth). Nevertheless, it’s a very
    simple and versatile comforting dish that you can try to cook by yourself during this stay-at-home period.</p>
