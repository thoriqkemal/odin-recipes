  <h1 id="header">4 | Martabak</h1>
  <p>Martabak are savory light bites that originated from a Middle-Eastern recipe of the same name. It is basically a
    spicy omelet pancake stuffed with bits of vegetables and minced meat and can be bought from almost any street vendor
    in Indonesia after sunset. Palembang, with Martabak HAR, and Aceh, with Martabak Aceh, are two of the few regions in
    Indonesia that have given their own twist to Martabak. There is also another general variant of Martabak called
    Martabak Manis (other regions, such as Malang, call it ‘Kue Terang Bulan’), which is basically a large pancake
    stuffed with toppings like chocolate, cheese, and peanuts. It might look complicated, but it’s actually very easy to
    make and the ingredients are available at many shops near you.</p>

    <li>100 g plain flour</li>
    <li>25 g tapioca flour</li>
    <li>250 ml cold water</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="section">How to Make</h3>
  <p><strong>Filling</strong>: Sauté onion in vegetable oil for a couple of seconds. Add the meat and stir-fry until it
    changes color. Then put in leek and continue sautéing for 2 or 3 minutes before adding curry powder, cumin, salt,
    and pepper. Mix all the spices and cook for 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Put the fillings in a bowl and add the eggs
    and spring onion. Mix well.</p>
  <p><strong>Dough</strong>: Mix all the ingredients in a bowl until they blend completely without any lumps. Then pour
    2-3 tablespoon of the batter into a pre-heated, non-stick frying pan. Make sure the dough covers the whole surface
    of the pan. Remove when it’s done.</p>
  <p><strong>Martabak</strong>: Put 2 teaspoons of filling onto the center of the dough, take the skin and fold in from
    side to side to completely cover the filling in an envelope fashion. Fry until it turns golden brown on one side and
    then turns it over to cook the other side. Serve warm.</p>
