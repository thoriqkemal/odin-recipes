        Home to a variety of herbs and spices, Indonesia has so many delicious foods to offer. The rich ethnicity's and
        the
        tradition of passing down signature recipes from generation to generation have blessed this country with an
        unlimited amount of dishes that range from traditional to popular, to easy-to-make. You can find all the
        ingredients
        for these dishes at your nearest shops. While at home in self-quarantine, you can make good use of your cooking
        skills and “travel” to Indonesia by recreating these 5 popular Indonesian dishes. In case, you can’t find an
        ingredient at your nearest store, you can replace it with a substitute and give the recipe your own twist.

        Put these dishes on your Indonesia bucket list; you won’t have trouble finding them when you’re finally able to
        travel tomorrow.
